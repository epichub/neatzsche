 *   
 *   Test code for the slave process.  At the moment it simply returns
 *   the input multiplied with the startup argument after a random
 *   amount of time.  Normally the process will wait a few seconds
 *   before returning, but with with a certain probability it will wait considerably longer.  The possibly long wait is supposed to imitate a crash,
 *   an infinite loop or something similar.
