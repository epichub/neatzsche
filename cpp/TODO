* Rewrite to MPI and OpenMP
* Make crossover "packets" that contain two paired genomes for crossover, send out through MPI/OpenMP
* Clean up build process
Later:
* Make NEATzsche a library to link against.
* OY, darwinism is also forming a tree, sub-evolution(random search) striving against

* tree streatches branches towards light, as nerves stretches towards
