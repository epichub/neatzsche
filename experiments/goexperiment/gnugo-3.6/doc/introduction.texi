@section About GNU Go and this Manual

The challenge of Computer Go is not to @strong{beat} the computer,
but to @strong{program} the computer. 

In Computer Chess, strong programs are capable of playing at the highest
level, even challenging such a player as Garry Kasparov. No Go program
even as strong as amateur shodan exists. The challenge is to write such
a program.

To be sure, existing Go programs are strong enough to be interesting
as opponents, and the hope exists that some day soon a truly
strong program can be written. 

GNU Go is getting stronger. GNU Go 3.6 plays at about the level of
9 kyu.

Until now, Go programs have always been distributed as binaries
only. The algorithms in these proprietary programs are secret. No-one
but the programmer can examine them to admire or criticise. As a
consequence, anyone who wished to work on a Go program usually had to
start from scratch. This may be one reason that Go programs have not
reached a higher level of play.

Unlike most Go programs, GNU Go is Free Software. Its algorithms and
source code are open and documented. They are free for any one to
inspect or enhance. We hope this freedom will give GNU Go's descendents
a certain competetive advantage.

Here is GNU Go's Manual. There are doubtless inaccuracies. The ultimate
documentation is in the commented source code itself.

The first three chapters of this manual are for the general
user. Chapter 3 is the User's Guide. The rest of the book is for
programmers, or persons curious about how GNU Go works.  Chapter 4 is a
general overview of the engine.  Chapter 5 introduces various tools for
looking into the GNU Go engine and finding out why it makes a certain
move, and Chapters 6--7 form a general programmer's reference to the GNU
Go API. The remaining chapters are more detailed explorations of
different aspects of GNU Go's internals.

@section The GNU Go Task List

You can help make GNU Go the best Go program.

This is a task-list for anyone who is interested in helping with GNU
Go. If you want to work on such a project you should correspond with
us until we reach a common vision of how the feature will work!

A note about copyright. The Free Software Foundation has the copyright
to GNU Go. For this reason, before any code can be accepted as a part of
the official release of GNU Go, the Free Software Foundation will want
you to sign a copyright assignment. 

Of course you could work on a forked version without signing
such a disclaimer. You can also distribute such a forked version of the
program so long as you also distribute the source code to your
modifications under the GPL (@pxref{GPL}). But if you want
your changes to the program to be incorporated into the
version we distribute we need you to assign the copyright.

Please contact the GNU Go maintainers, Daniel Bump
(@email{bump@@sporadic.stanford.edu}) and Gunnar Farneb@"ack
(@email{gunnar@@lysator.liu.se}), to get more information and the
papers to sign.

Below is a list of things YOU could work on. We are already working on
some of these tasks, but don't let that stop you. Please contact us or
the person assigned to task for further discussion.


@subsection General

@itemize

@item If you can, send us bug FIXES as well as bug reports. If you see
   some bad behavior, figure out what causes it, and what to do about
   fixing it. And send us a patch! If you find an interesting bug and
   cannot tell us how to fix it, we would be happy to have you tell us
   about it anyway. Send us the sgf file (if possible) and attach
   other relevant information, such as the GNU Go version number. In
   cases of assertion failures and segmentation faults we probably
   want to know what operating system and compiler you were using, in
   order to determine if the problem is platform dependent.

@end itemize


@subsection Smaller projects

These issues are of tactical nature, i.e. they concern some specific
feature or the infrastructure of the engine.  Some of these are quiet
small, maybe doable in a day for an experienced GNU Go programmer.
They might also be useful project to start with for a new project
member.  Some of them are bigger and demand a deeper knowledge of the
engine internals.  The issues are presented here in an approximate
order of perceived difficulty.

@itemize
@item
Add more checks in @file{patterns/mkpat.c} testing whether the main diagram and
the constraint diagram are consistent.
@item Break out handling of movelists into its own file and generalize it.
This is started in 3.1.16. Move lists are used, among other places, 
in worms.c where it is used to store moves that capture, save, 
threaten to capture and threaten to save the worm.
@item Implement move lists storing important moves for dragons and eyes
in the same way as it is used for worms.  Half eyes are already
halfway done.  The moves are stored, but not the attack and defend
codes (LOSE, KO_A, KO_B and WIN).
@item Make the cache not waste storage on 64 bit systems.
@item  Implement detection of superko violation in the board code. We
probably only want this optionally in @code{play_move()} and in a variant
of @code{is_legal()}.
@item The dragon data is split into two arrays, @code{dragon[]}
and @code{dragon2[]}. The dragon2 array only have one entry per dragon, in
contrast to the dragon array where all the data is stored once for every
intersection of the board.  Complete the conversion of eye_data,
half_eye_data, worm and dragon to use the same structure as the dragon2 array.
@item Support for ko in eyes.db and optics.c.
@item Integrate the time handling code in play_gtp.c with the autolevel
code in @file{clock.c}. Alternatively, replace them both with something
better. Basing it on some solid system identification theory and/or
control theory wouldn't hurt.
@item Write a script which plays through the joseki databases and checks
that the engine really generates a joseki move for all positions in
the databases. This would also be interesting to run with the
@option{--nojosekidb}  option.
@end itemize

@subsection Long term issues

These issues are strategic in nature. They will help us to improve the
playing strength of the program and/or enhance certain aspects of it.

@itemize
@item Extend the regression test suites.
@quotation
See the texinfo manual in the doc directory for a description of
how to do this. In particular it would be useful with test suites
for common life and death problems. Currently second line groups, L
groups and the tripod shape are reasonably well covered, but there
is for example almost nothing on comb formations, carpenter's
square, and so on. Other areas where test suites would be most
welcome are fuseki, tesuji, and endgame.
@end quotation
@item Tuning the pattern databases. 
@quotation
These are under constant revision. Tuning them is a sort of art. It is not
necessary to do any programming to do this since most of the patterns do not
require helpers. We would like it if a few more Dan level players would learn
this skill.
@end quotation
@item Extend and tune the Joseki database. 
@quotation
It might be very useful to implement a semi-automatic way of doing this.
The current method based on sgf files become difficult to maintain with
existing tools.  
@end quotation
@item The semeai module is still in need of improvement. (This is underway.)
@item GNU Go does not have a move generator that tries explicitly to build
moyos, or reduce/invade opponent's moyos. Such a move generator could
be built using the same type of code that is used in the owl life and
death reader, or the connection reader mentioned in point 5 above.
@item A much improved combination module.  
@quotation
The combination module of
today only finds combinations of threats to capture enemy groups.
A more useful combination module would e.g. find combinations of
threats to capture a group or enter opponent territory.  It would
also be strong enough to find combinations of strategic moves and
more indirect threats (a threat to a threat).  Possibly it could
combine threats in AND-OR trees (DAGs?) that could be searched
using ordinary tree search algorithms. (Revision of @file{combination.c}
is underway.)
@end quotation
@item  Speed up the tactical reading. 
@quotation
GNU Go is reasonably accurate when it comes to tactical reading, but not
always very fast.  The main problem is that too many ineffective moves are
tested, leading to strange variations that shouldn't need consideration.  To
improve one could refine the move generation heuristics in the reading.  Also,
one should implement some more of the standard tree search optimizations used
in alpha-beta readers.
@end quotation
@item Improve the heuristics for assessment of the safety of a group.
@quotation
This might take into account number of eyes / half eyes, moyo in
corners, moyo along the edge, moyo in the center, proximity to living
friendly groups, weak opponent groups etc. It is of particular interest
to be able to accurately determine how a move affects the safety of all
groups on the board.
@end quotation
@end itemize

@subsection Ideas

These are some ideas that have been floated on the mailing list.  Some
of them are down-to-earth, and some are just blue sky ramblings.  They
are presented here for inspiration.

@itemize
@item A good GUI.
@quotation
A start is being made with GoThic, a goban widget based on the QT
toolkit.  This is linked from the GNU Go development web page on
gnu.org. Other starts have been made based on GTK, but so far
nothing more than a start has been attempted.
@end quotation
@item  A graphical pattern editor.
@quotation
This would make it much easier for non-programmers to improve the
strength of GNU Go.  It could also be used as a debugging tool for
the programmers.  This project has the GUI as a prerequisite.
The challenge here is not to make a tool which makes it easier to
create patterns but to make it easier to overview and maintain the
database.
@end quotation
@item Make the engine thread safe and use multiple CPUs on an SMP
machine.
@item Making the engine use many machines loosely connected on the
internet or in a cluster.
@item Think on the opponent's time.
@item A global alpha-beta reader.  
@quotation
This would probably be very slow and could only read 2 or 3 moves ahead.
Still it could find fatal errors and improve the moves that GNU Go makes.
@end quotation
@item 
@quotation
A strategic module that identifies high-level goals and then gives
these goals to the rest of the engine.  It should be able to
identify if we are ahead in territory or thickness, if we should
play safe or if we should play daringly (e.g. if behind).  It
should also identify weak areas where we can attack or where we
should defend.  Maybe this module doesn't have to be written in C.
Maybe PROLOG, LISP or some other AI language would be better.
@end quotation
@item A parameter that makes GNU Go play different styles.  
@quotation
Such styles could be 'play for territory', 'play aggressively', 'play tricky
moves (hamete)', and so on.  It could be used to present human users with
different kinds of opponents or to tell GNU Go how to play certain computer
opponents in tournaments.
@end quotation
@item Generalize representation and handling of threats so that we have a
graph representation of threats that can be searched to see how different
threats interact.
@item An endgame module based on ideas from combinatorial game theory.
@quotation
To be really useful this would have to deal with early endgame
positions.
@end quotation
@item Automated fuseki tuning 
@quotation
Fuseki tuning by hand is difficult. I'd like to encourage people who
are interested in doing machine learning experiments with GNU Go
work with the fuseki. This may be one of the areas with most
potential for substantial and reasonably quick improvements.
@end quotation
@item More elaborate classification of ko
@quotation
Create a paradigm for handling other types of ko (approach move ko,
multi-step ko, etc) and then write code that handles them.
@end quotation
